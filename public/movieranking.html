        <h1>The Best Movies According to Todd</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>It's A Wonderful Life</h3>
 <p>One of the most heart warming Christmas films with a great message. It also has beautiful scenery in the fictional town of Bedford Falls, NY.  </p>
 <h3>12 Monkeys</h3>
 <p>A very interesting vision of the future from one of the most unique directors, Terry Gilliam. Inspiring story that there is always hope to change, either as an individual or a species.</p>
 <h3>The Truman Show</h3>
 <p>One of my favorite Jim Carey film where he excels at portraying a man maintaining his sanity and preserving his sense of reality. As his world is crumbling around him, Carey's Truman gives a stellar example of how to be brave in the face of adversity and take control of his own destiny.</p>
